	<b> <p id="pag2">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI'm one of the owners that handles the Cebu City Room Rental. I'm a student taking the Bachelor in Science of Information Technology. I'm 18 years old and currently residing in Inayawan Cebu City. It takes courage to launch a small business. To build a great business, one must put in a lot of time and overcome various obstacles. However, the majority of business owners will tell you that it's well worth the effort to run your own company. </p> </b>
