	<h1>Junior High School</h1>
	 <p id="pag1">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In my high school level, I learned many things from my subjects. It is fun and exciting and meeting new friends. We share jokes and laughter. Sometimes we are being scolded by our teachers due to being very talkative. Sometimes we dont listen to our lesson, sometimes we copy each others assignments and we tease each other. In the first day of my class i am so naughty with that my teacher caught me talking with my seatmates then she confornted me and giving some advice but most of them kay isog na pag ka talk so i was scared that time because maybe she might have a heart atttack caused by his age. I was afraid of it because maybe she will let me out of her class so what i did is I just sit i still remain calm but deep inside im already peeing. I regret of what happened last 2015 I guess.
