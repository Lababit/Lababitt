<h1>Senior High School</h1>
 <p id="pag1"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is how my senior high school life started , first day of school. I felt excited and nervous. Excited in such a way that I will be able to experience another journey of my life. Nervous in the sense that I will be facing new classmates , new teachers and new friends . Nevertheless , the nervous I felt in the first day slowly gone and filled with happiness. I was able to gained new friends . Most of them are my schoolmate and some of them are transferees from other school. I really thought that my senior high school would be very boring ,but I was wrong.  I donâ€™t expect that I would be enjoying with my new friends and my classmates. I really treasure every single days with them , with their craziness in life.
