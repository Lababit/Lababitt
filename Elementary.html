<h1>Elementary</h1>
 <p id="pag1"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMy elementary school years were exciting and enjoyable. It's both challenging and exciting.
Elementary school is full of memorable memories that taught you to appreciate small things.
It was difficult to balance sports and academics, but you will get used to it in the days ahead. Although it is difficult but, to be honest it was so fun meeting new friends from various parts of the Cebu and having a memorable experience. What matters most is that I learned and I am proud to have completed it.
